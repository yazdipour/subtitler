Hi. This is Shahriar Yazdipour.
Here I want to answer a couple of your questions.

1. Why Subtitler was offline for two months!?

    Subtitler Server was out of reach. I did not pay the server provider, so they disconnect the server.
2. Why?

    I am a student, and the crisis in Iran, it is not possible for me to pay for something that has no income for me.
3. Now what?

    Old versions of the Subtitler will never work for sure. In this version, I am using Heroku free servers. The main problem of using these servers is that, if in 30 minutes, nobody uses the application, servers will go offline. And restarting them may take a while.
4. Any good news?

    The good news is that Subtitler is now Open Source and available at Github.

    Now, You can have a look at application and server-side code, and also contribute to make Subtitler better.

    Server: https://github.com/yazdipour/subtitler-server

    App: https://github.com/yazdipour/subtitler

5. Wanna Donate!?
